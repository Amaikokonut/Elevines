# Elevines

Elevines are a system of customizable elevators. Shift-clicking on the Elevine creates a duplicate of the same color, while ctrl+clicking creates an elevine of a different color.

Creatures pushing pulling (to go down) or pushing (to go up) will be transported to the next lowest or highest elevine of the same color. The top and bottom orbs on the elevine turn green when there is another elevine of the same color available to move either up or down to.

Shift+clicking an elevine will destroy it-- an easy way to get rid of extras.
