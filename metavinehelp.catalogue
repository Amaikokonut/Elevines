"Metavines"
"Metavines are a system of customizable doors for metaroom-to-metaroom travel. Shift+clicking on the metavine creates a duplicate of the same color, while ctrl+clicking creates an dovine of a different color. \n\nCreatures pushing or pulling will be transported to the next metavine of the same color. The top and bottom orbs on the dovine turn indigo when there is another metavine of the same color available.\n\nShift+ctrl clicking an metavine will destroy it-- an easy way to get rid of extras.\n\nBeautiful sprites courtesy of Mea!"
